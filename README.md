# Simple Exif Reader

This is a small and simple tool to edit exif data from images by using Python and TkInter.
I Wrote this because first I wanted to dive a bit deeper into GUI Dev with Python and second I did not want to install an extra tool for this purpose.

## Requiremnts
Python 3.9.x

All other required libraries:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
