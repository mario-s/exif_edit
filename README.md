# Simple Exif Reader

This is a small and simple tool to edit exif data from images by using Python and TkInter.

I wrote this because:
 1. I wanted to dive a bit deeper into GUI development with Python.
 2. I did not want to install an extra tool to read Exif data from images.

## Requirements
Python 3.9.x

All other required libraries:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Testing
`python3 -m unittest`

## Running
`python3 exif_edit`
